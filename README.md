# Birdeee_Mapping_RShiny

**Birdee_Mapping_RShiny** is an interactive Shiny app built in R that allows individual users to visualize and analyze their own eBird data. By uploading data directly from Cornellâ€™s eBird database, users can explore bird species sightings at a global scale or within the U.S. at the county level. The app provides a variety of options for customizing map visualizations and exporting the results for further use.

## Key Features

- **Global Species Density Map:**  
  Visualize species density worldwide using a hexgrid map, based on your own eBird data. This map displays the density of species you have observed across the globe.

- **County-Level Data (U.S.):**  
  View detailed sightings at the county level for the lower 48 U.S. states, based solely on your own submitted checklists.

- **Interactive Map Adjustments:**  
  Customize your map by:
  - Modifying map breaks for more granular data visualization.
  - Choosing whether to display GPS coordinates for individual checklists.
  - Customizing the color of checklist points.

- **Export Maps as PNGs:**  
  Download your customized maps as PNG files for use in reports, presentations, or personal analysis.

Examples of how to use the app and its features are provided in the documentation.
