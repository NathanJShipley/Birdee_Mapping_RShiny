#Birdy_Mapping_RShiny

Birdy_Mapping_RShiny is an interactive Shiny app built in R that allows individual users to visualize and analyze their own eBird data. By uploading data directly from Cornellâ€™s eBird database, users can explore bird species sightings at a global scale or within the U.S. at the county level. The app provides a variety of options for customizing map visualizations and exporting the results for further use.

Key Features:
Global Species Density Map: Visualize species density worldwide using a hexgrid map, based on your own eBird data. This map displays the density of species you have observed across the globe.
County-Level Data (U.S.): View detailed sightings at the county level for the lower 48 U.S. states, based solely on your own submitted checklists.
Interactive Map Adjustments: Users can:
Modify map breaks for more granular data visualization.
Choose whether to map GPS coordinates for individual checklists.
Customize the color of checklist points to suit your preferences.
Export Maps: Download maps as PNG files for use in reports, presentations, or personal analysis.
